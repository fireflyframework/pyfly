"""Backpressure strategies for the transactional engine.

Three implementations of :class:`BackpressureStrategyPort`:

* :class:`AdaptiveBackpressureStrategy` -- dynamically adjusts concurrency
* :class:`BatchedBackpressureStrategy` -- fixed batch size processing
* :class:`CircuitBreakerBackpressureStrategy` -- opens circuit after threshold failures

Plus a :class:`BackpressureStrategyFactory` for creating strategies by name.

    Populated during TCC registration by inspecting

    Attributes:
        id: Unique participant identifier within the TCC transaction.
        order: Execution order (lower values execute first).
        timeout_ms: Participant-level timeout in milliseconds (0 = no timeout).
        optional: Whether the participant is optional.
        participant_class: The nested class decorated with ``@tcc_participant``,
            or ``None`` if not resolved.
        try_method: Resolved reference to the try-phase method, or ``None``.
        confirm_method: Resolved reference to the confirm-phase method, or ``None``.
        cancel_method: Resolved reference to the cancel-phase method, or ``None``.

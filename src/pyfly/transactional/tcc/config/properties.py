"""TCC engine configuration properties.

Plain dataclass holding TCC settings.
Auto-configuration will bind these to YAML config later.

YAML structure::

    pyfly:
      transactional:
        tcc:
          enabled: true
          default_timeout_ms: 30000
          retry_enabled: true
          max_retries: 3
          backoff_ms: 1000
          persistence_enabled: true
          metrics_enabled: true

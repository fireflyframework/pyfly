    """Immutable descriptor holding all metadata for one saga step.

    Populated during saga registration by inspecting ``__pyfly_saga_step__``
    metadata on decorated methods.

    Attributes:
        id: Unique step identifier within the saga.
        step_method: Bound method implementing the forward action, or ``None``
            for external steps resolved later.
        compensate_name: Name of the compensation method on the saga bean,
            or ``None`` if the step has no compensation.
        compensate_method: Resolved bound compensation method, or ``None``.
        depends_on: Step ids that must complete before this step can execute.
        retry: Number of retry attempts for the forward action.
        backoff_ms: Base backoff duration in milliseconds between retries.
        timeout_ms: Execution timeout in milliseconds (0 = no timeout).
        jitter: Whether to add jitter to the backoff duration.
        jitter_factor: Fraction of backoff used as jitter range.
        cpu_bound: Whether to offload execution to a thread/process pool.
        idempotency_key: Template string for deduplication, or ``None``.
        compensation_retry: Override retry count for the compensation action.
        compensation_backoff_ms: Override backoff for the compensation action.
        compensation_timeout_ms: Override timeout for the compensation action.
        compensation_critical: If ``True``, saga failure is raised when
            compensation itself fails.

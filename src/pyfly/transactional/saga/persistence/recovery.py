"""Saga recovery service — recover interrupted sagas from persistence.

This module provides :class:`SagaRecoveryService`, which loads stale
in-flight saga executions from the persistence layer and marks them as
failed so the system can move forward.  An optional events port is used
to emit warning-level lifecycle events for each recovered saga.

class SagaRecoveryService:
    """Recovers interrupted saga executions by loading stale in-flight sagas and compensating.

    The recovery service is designed to run periodically (e.g. via a
    scheduler) to detect sagas that have been stuck in an ``IN_FLIGHT``
    state longer than a configurable threshold.  Such sagas are marked as
    ``FAILED`` in persistence and a lifecycle event is emitted when an
    events port is available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    persistence_port:
        Adapter satisfying :class:`TransactionalPersistencePort` used to
        query and update saga execution state.
    saga_engine:
        Optional reference to the :class:`SagaEngine`.  Accepted as
        ``Any`` to avoid circular import issues.  Reserved for future use
        when active compensation replay is implemented.
    events_port:
        Optional adapter satisfying :class:`TransactionalEventsPort` used
        to emit lifecycle events for recovered sagas.

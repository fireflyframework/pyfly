    """Base document providing audit trail fields.

    All MongoDB documents should inherit from this class to get automatic
    ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` / ``created_by`` / ``updated_by`` tracking.

    The ``id`` field is inherited from :class:`beanie.Document` as a
    ``PydanticObjectId``. Subclasses configure their collection name via
    ``class Settings: name = "..."``.

    Example::

        class UserDocument(BaseDocument):
            name: str
            email: str

            class Settings:

    updated_by: str | None = None

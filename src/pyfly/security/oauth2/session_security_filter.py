    ``SecurityFilter`` (at ``+250``) and the ``OAuth2ResourceServerFilter``
    (at ``+250``).  This ensures session-based authentication takes priority
    over token-based authentication.

    If a ``SECURITY_CONTEXT`` attribute is found in the session, it is set on
    ``request.state.security_context``.  Otherwise an anonymous context is
    set so downstream filters and handlers always have a context available.
